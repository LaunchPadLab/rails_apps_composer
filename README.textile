h3. Generate an Application Interactively

You'll be prompted for recipes and gems:

<pre>
$ rails_apps_composer new myapp

h3. Generate an Application from Defaults

Use a defaults file for recipes, preferences, and extra gems so you don't have to provide them interactively. Then generate an application using the @-d@ flag:

<pre>
$ rails_apps_composer new myapp -d my_defaults.yaml
</pre>

Use the @my_defaults.yaml@ file to specify a list of recipes, preferences, and extra gems. You can use any name (and file extension) for the file. See the "Defaults File":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-apps-composer.html#Defaults section in the Guide concerning the format of the defaults file.

Use the "quiet flag" @-q@ if you want to skip all prompts:

<pre>
$ rails_apps_composer new myapp -q -d my_defaults.yaml
</pre>
